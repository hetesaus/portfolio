Lance Krasniqi, Viktor Trisjin and myself with additional help from Jaqceline van Rijn, Jom Semah for concept art and Manglemoose for everything audio related. We developed this game at the end of our third year going into our last year.<br><br>My role was being the bridge between coding and art. I developed a lot of the core style of the game, layed a lot of visual groundwork for the rest to work upon, developed the characters and animations and helped with the overall design of the game.<br><br>We took the game to a lot of events and have won quite some awards along the way. We won the Indigo audience award which gave us the opportunity to showcase our game at Central European Game Conference (CEGC) in Viennna. Where to our own surprise we also won the audience award. We also submitted the game for the Dutch Game Awards where we got 2 nominations and won the \'Best Student Art Direction\' award.","logoSrc":"assets/images/logos/rogues.png","imgSrc":"assets/images/overview/rogues_1.png","tags":["action","adventure","roguelite","online","multiplayer","low poly","procedural generated","4 player"],"achievements":{"awards":[{"img":"assets/gifs/awards/dga.gif","text":"Winner<br/>Best Student Art Direction</br>Dutch Game Awards</br>2016"},{"img":"assets/gifs/awards/cegc.gif","text":"Winner<br/>Audience Award</br>CEGC<br/>2016"},{"img":"assets/gifs/awards/indigo.gif","text":"Winner<br/>Audience Award</br>Indigo<br/>2015"}],"nominations":[{"img":"assets/images/awards/unity2.png","text":"Nominated<br/>Golden Cube</br>Unity Awards</br>2016"},{"img":"assets/images/awards/unity2.png","text":"Nominated<br/>Best Student Project</br>Unity Awards</br>2016"},{"img":"assets/images/awards/dga_outline1.png","text":"Nomination<br/>Best Student Game Design</br>Dutch Game Awards</br>2016"},{"img":"assets/images/awards/dga_outline1.png","text":"Nomination<br/>Best Student Technical</br>Dutch Game Awards</br>2016"},{"img":"assets/images/awards/indievelopment.png","text":"Runner Up<br/>Student Award</br>Indievelopment<br/>2015"},{"img":"assets/images/awards/indievelopment.png","text":"Runner Up<br/>Audience Award</br>Indievelopment<br/>2015"}]},"content":[{"type":"youtube","preview":"assets/images/previews/rogues_youtube.png","src":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gxnbt_ZqJVw"},{"type":"youtube","preview":"assets/images/previews/rogues_youtube.png","src":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HI2dH6dS5t0"},{"type":"image","preview":"assets/images/previews/rogues_promo_campfire.png","src":"assets/images/screens/rogues_promo_campfire.png"},{"type":"image","preview":"assets/images/previews/rogues_promo_starwars.png","src":"assets/images/screens/rogues_promo_starwars.png"},{"type":"image","preview":"assets/images/previews/rogues_promo_prometheus.png","src":"assets/images/screens/rogues_promo_prometheus.png"},{"type":"image","preview":"assets/images/previews/rogues_01.png","src":"assets/images/screens/rogues_01.png"},{"type":"image","preview":"assets/images/previews/rogues_02.png","src":"assets/images/screens/rogues_02.png"},{"type":"image","preview":"assets/images/previews/rogues_03.png","src":"assets/images/screens/rogues_03.png"},{"type":"image","preview":"assets/images/previews/rogues_04.png","src":"assets/images/screens/rogues_04.png"},{"type":"image","preview":"assets/images/previews/rogues_05.png","src":"assets/images/screens/rogues_05.png"}]},{"id":1,"title":"Action Farm","engine":"","roles":"","category":"Games","duration":"duration","year":"year","shortDescription":"short description","description":"description","logoSrc":"","imgSrc":"assets/images/overview/rogues_1.png","tags":[],"achievements":{},"content":[]},{"id":2,"title":"Action Henk (fanart)","engine":"Photoshop","roles":"Artist","category":"Fan art","duration":"3 days (part time)","year":"2014","shortDescription":"short description","description":"This artwork was part of my internship, as a member of the art team of ‘Codeglue’ my first assignment was to make some fan art of a game they were helping out, called ‘Action Henk’.
