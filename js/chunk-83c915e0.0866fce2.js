Having viewed a lot of tournaments I noticed I wanted to enhance this viewing experience. You mostly only view one stream with audio at a time, but you want to be able to easily switch between streams without having to mute the others. Then I came across an image online of a tv broadcast monitor having all camera angles on one screen. I wanted something like this for my viewing client, but only view one stream with audio/quality and manage all the settings for the other displays. Something like a television, but always having previews of other channels on screen. </br></br>So I combined both ideas and came to this viewing client, there is one main stream and 3 alternate streams. The main stream has audio and will be the best quality available, while the alternative streams will be 360p muted. You can switch streams by clicking on one of the preview streams on the side. I also included a screen to select streams, an overview of all my following channels to select and change the order of streams. Right now it works off a clientID and a Oauth token, eventually I would like to rework this to a more simple twitch login.<br><br>Nowadays there is squad stream from Twitch itself, but it isn\'t controllable by the viewer itself, only the streamers themself. So thats where my multiviewer comes in, now you can watch 4 random streams at once.","logoSrc":"","sideImgSrc":"assets/images/sidepanel/twitch.png","tags":["multi","twitch","viewer","tournaments","evo"],"achievements":{},"links":[{"name":"Application","icon":"code","url":"https://hetesaus.github.io/webapps/twitchV2.html"},{"name":"Github","icon":"github","url":"https://github.com/hetesaus/webapps/blob/master/twitchV2.html"}],"content":[{"type":"image","preview":"assets/images/previews/multiviewer_1.png","src":"assets/images/screens/multiviewer_1.png"},{"type":"image","preview":"assets/images/previews/multiviewer_2.png","src":"assets/images/screens/multiviewer_2.png"}]},{"id":17,"title":"Scavenger","tools":"Unity3D, 3D Studio Max, Photoshop","category":"Games","team":"Solo project","role":"Artist, Developer","finished":true,"duration":"6 months","year":"2016","shortDescription":"Scavenger is a platformer with RPG elements.
